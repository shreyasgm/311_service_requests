### 3. Database Setup

Set up your Supabase instance:

1. Create a new project in Supabase
2. Enable PostGIS extension:
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Run: `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`
3. Create the necessary tables (use the migration script in `./backend/migrations/init.sql`)

### 4. Backend Implementation

#### 4.1 FastAPI Setup

The FastAPI backend should implement several key endpoints:

- **Create Service Request**: Accepts citizen reports and saves them to the database
- **Get Service Request**: Retrieves details about a specific report by ID
- **Update Service Request**: Updates status and other fields as a request progresses
- **List Service Requests**: Returns filtered lists of requests based on various criteria
- **Generate Department Report**: Creates aggregated reports for city departments

The API should use dependency injection for database access and implement proper error handling for various scenarios.

#### 4.2 LangGraph Agent Setup

The LangGraph AI orchestration should implement multiple agent types:

- **Information Gathering Agent**: Ensures all necessary details are collected from citizens
  - Asks follow-up questions when descriptions are vague
  - Confirms location details
  - Prompts for additional context when needed

- **Classification Agent**: Categorizes and prioritizes service requests
  - Determines request type from natural language description
  - Assigns appropriate priority level based on urgency and impact
  - Calculates confidence score for its determinations
  - Flags edge cases for human review

- **Geocoding Agent**: Enhances location data for better analysis
  - Converts text addresses to precise geographic coordinates
  - Identifies the relevant city district or neighborhood
  - Determines the responsible department based on location

Each agent should implement proper error handling and have fallback strategies for uncertain cases.

#### 4.3 Twilio Integration

The Twilio integration should handle the complete phone call workflow:

- **Initial Greeting**: Welcomes the caller and explains the purpose of the system
- **Speech Recognition**: Captures the citizen's description of the issue
- **Conversational Flow**: Uses AI agents to ask relevant follow-up questions
- **Confirmation**: Verifies understanding before finalizing the report
- **Status Provision**: Provides a tracking ID and completion confirmation

The integration should handle various edge cases like unclear speech, background noise, and disconnections gracefully.

### 5. Frontend Implementation

#### 5.1 Next.js Web Interface

The web interface should provide an intuitive user experience with several key pages:

- **Home Page**: Overview of the system with quick access to reporting and status checking
- **Report Form**: User-friendly form for submitting new service requests
- **Status Checker**: Tool for citizens to track their submitted reports
- **Public Dashboard**: Transparent view of citywide issues and resolution metrics

The interface should be responsive, accessible, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

#### 5.2 Report Submission Flow

The report submission process should include:

- **Description Input**: Free-text field for issue description
- **Location Selection**: Address input with map confirmation
- **AI Classification**: Automatic categorization with user verification
- **Priority Assignment**: AI-suggested priority with ability to adjust
- **Contact Information**: Optional fields for follow-up communication
- **Media Upload**: Option to attach photos of the issue
- **Confirmation**: Clear summary before final submission

   - Call the Twilio number
   - Report: "There's a pothole on Main Street near the library"
   - Verify classification and follow-up questions
   - Confirm the system asks for additional details if needed
   - Check that a confirmation message is provided
   - Verify the report appears in the database with correct details

2. **Web Interface Flow**:
   - Submit a report through the web form
   - Verify AI classification matches the description
   - Check status using the tracking ID
   - Verify map visualization shows the report correctly positioned
   - Test different issue types to ensure proper categorization
   - Test edge cases with vague descriptions

## üîç AI Considerations

### Ethics & Bias

- The system should be regularly audited for bias in classification and prioritization
- Demographics data should be anonymized
- Geographic distribution of reports should be analyzed for underrepresentation

### Privacy

- Personal information is minimized in reports
- Contact details are optional and only used for status updates
- Location data is used only at the necessary precision level

### Human Oversight

- Requests with overall confidence below 0.7, validation confidence below 0.8, or classification confidence below 0.75 trigger human review
- Department staff can override AI classifications
- System logs all AI decisions for auditing purposes

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (current)
- Basic phone and web input
- AI classification and prioritization
- Simple reporting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics
- Predictive service needs
- Historical trend analysis
